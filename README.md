# **👋 Hi there\! I'm Ashley**

Welcome to my GitHub\! I'm a recent **Computer Engineering graduate** from the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign** (🎓 May 2025), with a passion for **UI/UX design** and **Machine Learning**.

## **💡 About Me**

Beyond engineering, I’m deeply interested in **fashion and sewing**, and I love blending creativity with technology. Many of the projects I’m currently working on are inspired by my personal interests — whether that’s **designing user interfaces**, experimenting with **machine learning**, or building tools that reflect my love for **style and sustainability**.

Most of the clothes I own are **thrifted**, and I’ve taught myself to **upcycle** and customize each piece to make it uniquely mine — something I also strive to do in my engineering work: take existing systems and make them more personal, beautiful, and efficient.
