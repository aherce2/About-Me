## Project Summary

Our project is to create a website, DineDash, to find a restaurant that matches your specific needs such as specific dietary restrictions, food preferences, pricing, etc. Deciding on a restaurant that meets the desired combinations can be a very difficult task so we wanted to create DineDash to solve this problem.
