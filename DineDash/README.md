# **DineDash â€“ CS 411 Database Systems Project**

This project was developed as part of **CS 411 â€“ Database Systems**. Our team worked with a relational database using MySQL and built a web application that supports full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Although I was originally assigned to front-end design, my role expanded significantly. I contributed to:

* **Database creation and setup**

* **Data verification and correction**

* **Backend integration**

* **Front-end implementation**

The backend was hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, so the live website is unfortunately no longer available for viewing. However, this folder contains all relevant **source code**, and the `docs/` directory includes our **project report**, **UML diagram**, and **proposal document** submitted for the course.

### **ðŸ“Œ Project Summary**

**DineDash** is a web application designed to help users find restaurants that best match their specific needs, such as dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, budget, and more. Choosing a place to eat can be overwhelming with so many variablesâ€”**DineDash aims to simplify that decision**.

### **ðŸ’¡ Description**

Users log into the DineDash application and input their **preferences** and **dietary restrictions** through a user-friendly interface. The application processes this data and runs queries on a curated **restaurant database** to identify the most relevant matches.

Restaurants are **filtered and ranked** based on how well they align with user criteria. Final results are displayed on the front-end, showing key details like:

* Restaurant name and location

* Average rating

* Price range

* Menu items
