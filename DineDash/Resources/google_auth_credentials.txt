In order to use connection to the gcp project you have to do this:

Go to IAM & admin on the gcp console project
Click on the service account
Go to keys and click add key and choose key type json
This will auto download the json file with the service account
On windows you would want to do this in powershell/terminal:
    $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH" 
KEY_PATH is the json file path
