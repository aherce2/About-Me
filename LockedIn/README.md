# **📱 LockedIn – CS 465 User Interface Design Project**

**LockedIn** is an Android application created for **CS 465 – User Interface Design**. This course emphasized human-centered design and walked students through the full UI/UX process—from identifying user needs to prototyping, testing, and implementing a functional interface.

Our group designed *LockedIn*, a study planner aimed at helping students improve focus and productivity through **personalized study schedules** and **reward-based motivation**.

### **✨ Project Highlights**

* **Course**: CS 465 – User Interface Design

* **Platform**: Android

* **Role**: Contributed to design, implementation, evaluation, and documentation

* **Technologies**: Java, Android SDK  
* **Deliverables included**: Source code, user evaluation presentations, low-fidelity mockups, walkthrough videos, and written reports

---

### **💡 Project Summary**

We created *LockedIn* to address a common issue students face: staying motivated and consistent while studying for exams. Our idea stemmed from a relatable incentive: *“If I finish this lecture, I’ll treat myself to ice cream.”* We turned this into a motivational tool that rewards users for sticking to their study plans.

### **🔍 Description**

**LockedIn** allows users to:

* Create customized study schedules based on their **availability**, **sleep schedule**, and **exam dates**

* Set **personalized rewards** to motivate them to complete study sessions (e.g., watching a show, taking a walk, eating out)

* Track progress toward study goals with **visual feedback**

* Receive reminders and insights tailored to their productivity habits

### **🧠 Course Experience**

Unlike many technical CS courses, CS 465 guided us through how **real-world UI/UX teams** operate:

* **User research** and focus groups

* **Low- and high-fidelity prototyping**

* **User testing and evaluation**

* Emphasis on **psychological and behavioral aspects** of design

This made it one of my favorite classes, as it merged technical development with design thinking. I especially appreciated how some of the ideas I shared during class brainstorming sessions were chosen and developed by other teams—a rewarding and validating experience.
